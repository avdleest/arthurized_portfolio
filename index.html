          Hi! My name is Arthur, and this portfolio website is part of a Codecademy Assignment for developping a new website based on HTML, CSS and a little bit of JavaScript.
          The projects on this portfolio site (...).

        <h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
        <p>
          Through the years, I've developed mainly in Python. But the project are not limited to coding and as such you'll find some other examples of projects down here.

                <p>I started photography when I was about 15 years old with a Canon Powershot S2 IS with an amazing resolution of 5.0 megapixel.
                  Two upgrades later and a bit of experience and good opportunities brought me to where I am now!

                <p>Buying a house back in 2017 enabled me (or forced me, actually ;-) ) to get better at building things. 
                  Since then I've constantly been developing new skills together with my friends. We share an arsenal of pretty great tools, and are still expanding.

                <h3>Coding</h3>
                <p>During my course of Aviation Engineering in Amsterdam, I started to gain interest in programming languages.
                  Starting with Excel and Visual Basic for Applications, I realized at some point that more was required to get somewhere. 
                  I got coding with Python and that escalted to JavaScript, HTML and CSS (as you can see here!).
